    <h2>Motivation of the Study</h2>
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is pervasive in many domains such as healthcare, Industry 4.0, and smart cities.

These applications involve massive amounts of IoT devices distributed across many decentralized networks.

Current Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) perform centralized window aggregation to process data from decentralized networks.

To reduce network overhead and resource consumption, state-of-the-art approaches suggest decentralized aggregation.

There are three issues in current stream processing: (i) decentralized window slicing, (ii) decentralized aggregation of count-based windows, and (iii) decentralized aggregation of windows with non-decomposable functions.

To deal with the above limitations we propose three approaches.

We design Desis, a stream processing system that efficiently processes concurrent windows in decentralized networks.

We propose Deco that has three schemes and enables processing count-based with decentralized aggregation while output correct results.

We introduce Dema that pushes down windows with non-decomposable functions close to data sources to calculate window aggregations decentralized.

Our work aims to propose a stream processing system that can efficiently process concurrent windows with different window types and aggregation functions in decentralized networks.

Desis is a stream processing system designed to process multi-queries in decentralized networks.

Desis proposes an aggregation engine to share partial results between multiple windows with different window types and different aggregation functions.

Desis can perform window slicing and share partial results on all nodes in the decentralized networks.

Desis significantly outperforms all baselines and scales well.

Desis can reduce over 99% network cost.

Deco is a decentralized aggregation approach that enables the split of count-based windows in decentralized networks.

To adapt to changing event rates and produce correct results, we propose Decomon.

To reduce communication overhead, we propose Decosync a synchronized approach that uses predicted local window sizes instead of actual local window sizes.

To further reduce communication overhead, we design Decoasync an asynchronous approach that moves the prediction from the root to local nodes.

Decomon monitors the event rates and always produces correct results even if the event rates change significantly.

Decosync and Decoasync predict window sizes and their predictions are verified in the verification step.

The results show that Decoasync has the highest throughput and lowest network cost since it moves calculations from the root node to local nodes and only sends partial results and a few events via the internet.

Dema is a decentralized approach designed to process windows with non-decomposable functions in decentralized networks.

Dema currently only supports functions that require sorting, such as median and quantile.

The core concept of Dema is similar to Deco, which involves multiple steps of coordination between local nodes and the root node.

In this paper, we present three approaches to improve window aggregations in decentralized setups.

We present Desis, a stream processing system that can efficiently process multiple queries in decentralized networks.

Desis facilitates the sharing of partial results among overlapping windows with varying window types and aggregation functions.

We also describe the Deco approaches, including three schemes, Decomon, Decosync, and Decoasync, which split count-based window aggregation in decentralized networks.

Deco adapts to changing event rates and ensures correct results.

Additionally, we introduce Dema, which allows decentralized aggregation to support non-decomposable functions.








    <h2>Original Abstract</h2>
    <p>The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications across domains such as healthcare, Industry 4.0, and smart cities has led to the deployment of vast numbers of devices in decentralized networks. Traditional Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) rely on centralized window aggregation, resulting in significant network overhead and resource consumption. To address these limitations, we present three decentralized approaches: Desis, Deco, and Dema. Desis is a stream processing system designed to process multiple concurrent windows in decentralized networks by sharing partial results across varying window types and aggregation functions, achieving substantial network cost reduction and performance improvements. Deco enables decentralized aggregation of count-based windows via three schemes—Decomon, Decosync, and Decoasync—that adapt to fluctuating event rates and reduce communication overhead while ensuring correctness. Finally, Dema supports decentralized aggregation of non-decomposable functions, such as median and quantile, by offloading computation to local nodes. Collectively, these approaches significantly reduce network traffic, improve throughput, and enhance scalability for decentralized stream processing in IoT environments.</p>
