    <h2>Motivation of the Study</h2>
    <p>As transient impact depends on the detailed timing of control events and traffic arrivals at each router, we turn to simulation to measure bad seconds since we do not have a large-scale dSDN deployment.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Since our simulator does not model individual components of the cSDN control infrastructure, we simulate cSDN as follows. Corresponding to each link failure event, we model 𝑇𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 and 𝑇𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝 by sampling from the measured distributions of these times in production.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>We observe the transit entry programming times to vary greatly between routers at all percentiles (median, 90th, 99th) by a factor of 10, and varying per-router 4x-11x between the median and the 99th percentile, going upwards of 70 seconds at the tail at the most loaded routers.</p>
    <p>An analysis of our WAN shows that FRR congestion is a leading cause for performance incidents, lasting up to several minutes and impacting hundreds of flows.</p>
    <p>We evaluate 3 custom FRR strategies against the traditional shortest path FRR selection. These strategies choose one or more bypass paths for each failure and make use of capacity and diversity constraints.</p>
    <p>Figure 19 shows a distribution from a two-week period over a total of 433,210,304 entry programming events of transit and encap programming times, aggregated over all routers in the solid line and for the slowest router in the dashed line.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, this provides insight on why the total 𝑇𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑔 in such a system is particularly long; the two-phase programming operation described above means programming a path is gated by the slowest response from transit entry programming along that path, and network-wide convergence is gated by the slowest path.</p>

    <h2>Original Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Software-defined networking (SDN) introduces centralized control for improved network flexibility and management. However, transient failures in distributed SDN (dSDN) and centralized SDN (cSDN) systems can lead to significant disruptions, necessitating an in-depth evaluation of failure recovery mechanisms. This study employs large-scale simulations to analyze the impact of control event timing and network traffic on transient failures. Our approach models cSDN by sampling failure recovery times from real-world distributions and simulating FRR (Fast Reroute) strategies to mitigate congestion-related performance incidents. Results indicate that transit entry programming times vary significantly across routers, with programming delays reaching over 70 seconds in highly loaded environments. Furthermore, analysis of WAN performance attributes prolonged FRR-induced congestion events affecting hundreds of flows. By evaluating three custom FRR strategies against conventional shortest-path selection, we identify the impact of path diversity and capacity constraints on failure mitigation. The findings highlight the bottlenecks associated with slow transit entry programming and the challenges of network-wide convergence in failure recovery scenarios. This work provides critical insights into improving SDN-based failure recovery strategies to enhance network reliability and performance.</p>
