    <h2>Motivation of the Study</h2>
    <p>As transient impact depends on the detailed timing of control events and traffic arrivals at each router, we turn to simulation to measure bad seconds since we do not have a large-scale dSDN deployment.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Since our simulator does not model individual components of the cSDN control infrastructure, we simulate cSDN as follows. Corresponding to each link failure event, we model 𝑇𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 and 𝑇𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝 by sampling from the measured distributions of these times in production.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>We observe the transit entry programming times to vary greatly between routers at all percentiles (median, 90th, 99th) by a factor of 10, and varying per-router 4x-11x between the median and the 99th percentile, going upwards of 70 seconds at the tail at the most loaded routers.</p>
    <p>An analysis of our WAN shows that FRR congestion is a leading cause for performance incidents, lasting up to several minutes and impacting hundreds of flows.</p>
    <p>We evaluate 3 custom FRR strategies against the traditional shortest path FRR selection. These strategies choose one or more bypass paths for each failure and make use of capacity and diversity constraints.</p>
    <p>Figure 19 shows a distribution from a two-week period over a total of 433,210,304 entry programming events of transit and encap programming times, aggregated over all routers in the solid line and for the slowest router in the dashed line.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, this provides insight on why the total 𝑇𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑔 in such a system is particularly long; the two-phase programming operation described above means programming a path is gated by the slowest response from transit entry programming along that path, and network-wide convergence is gated by the slowest path.</p>
