    <h2>Motivation of the Study</h2>
    <p>Metagenomic analysis suffers from significant data movement overhead because it requires accessing large amounts of low-reuse data.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p><strong>Metagenomic workflow:</strong> Given a metagenomic sample, a typical workflow consists of three key steps: (i) sequencing, (ii) basecalling, and (iii) metagenomic analysis.</p>
    <p>Due to its low reuse, the data needs to move all the way from the storage system to the main memory and processing units for its first use, and it will likely not be used again or reused very little during analysis.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>MegIS provides large average energy reductions of 5.4× and 1.9× compared to Kraken2 and Sieve, respectively, and 15.2× compared to accuracy-optimized Metalign.</p>
    <p>MegIS achieves 1.5×–5.1× speedup compared to state-of-the-art metagenomic tools while maintaining high accuracy.</p>
    <p>MegIS operates with a low area cost of 1.7% over the area of the three cores in an SSD controller.</p>
    <p>MegIS uses the same 701 GB k-mer database and a 14 GB sketch database for MegIS’s KSS sketch database.</p>

    <h2>Original Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Metagenomic analysis presents a significant computational challenge due to its high data movement overhead, requiring access to large amounts of low-reuse data. Traditional workflows involve sequencing, basecalling, and metagenomic analysis, with data frequently moving from storage to processing units, leading to inefficiencies in performance and energy consumption. This study introduces MegIS, a novel approach designed to mitigate these issues by optimizing data movement and computation. Experimental results demonstrate that MegIS achieves substantial energy reductions, outperforming Kraken2 and Sieve by factors of 5.4× and 1.9×, respectively, and reducing energy consumption by 15.2× compared to Metalign. Additionally, MegIS delivers speedups ranging from 1.5× to 5.1× over state-of-the-art metagenomic tools while maintaining high accuracy. With a minimal hardware footprint—occupying only 1.7% additional area over three SSD controller cores—MegIS offers an efficient, scalable solution for metagenomic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of MegIS to significantly improve the efficiency of large-scale metagenomic workflows, addressing critical bottlenecks in data movement and processing.</p>
