    <h2>Motivation of the Study</h2>
    <p>Metagenomic analysis suffers from significant data movement overhead because it requires accessing large amounts of low-reuse data.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p><strong>Metagenomic workflow:</strong> Given a metagenomic sample, a typical workflow consists of three key steps: (i) sequencing, (ii) basecalling, and (iii) metagenomic analysis.</p>
    <p>Due to its low reuse, the data needs to move all the way from the storage system to the main memory and processing units for its first use, and it will likely not be used again or reused very little during analysis.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>MegIS provides large average energy reductions of 5.4× and 1.9× compared to Kraken2 and Sieve, respectively, and 15.2× compared to accuracy-optimized Metalign.</p>
    <p>MegIS achieves 1.5×–5.1× speedup compared to state-of-the-art metagenomic tools while maintaining high accuracy.</p>
    <p>MegIS operates with a low area cost of 1.7% over the area of the three cores in an SSD controller.</p>
    <p>MegIS uses the same 701 GB k-mer database and a 14 GB sketch database for MegIS’s KSS sketch database.</p>
