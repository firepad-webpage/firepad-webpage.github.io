    Software-defined networking (SDN) introduces centralized control for improved network flexibility and management. However, transient failures in distributed SDN (dSDN) and centralized SDN (cSDN) systems can lead to significant disruptions, necessitating an in-depth evaluation of failure recovery mechanisms. This study employs large-scale simulations to analyze the impact of control event timing and network traffic on transient failures. Our approach models cSDN by sampling failure recovery times from real-world distributions and simulating FRR (Fast Reroute) strategies to mitigate congestion-related performance incidents. Results indicate that transit entry programming times vary significantly across routers, with programming delays reaching over 70 seconds in highly loaded environments. Furthermore, analysis of WAN performance attributes prolonged FRR-induced congestion events affecting hundreds of flows. By evaluating three custom FRR strategies against conventional shortest-path selection, we identify the impact of path diversity and capacity constraints on failure mitigation. The findings highlight the bottlenecks associated with slow transit entry programming and the challenges of network-wide convergence in failure recovery scenarios. This work provides critical insights into improving SDN-based failure recovery strategies to enhance network reliability and performance.</p>
