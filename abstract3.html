<p>The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications across domains such as healthcare, Industry 4.0, and smart cities has led to the deployment of vast numbers of devices in decentralized networks. Traditional Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) rely on centralized window aggregation, resulting in significant network overhead and resource consumption. To address these limitations, we present three decentralized approaches: Desis, Deco, and Dema. Desis is a stream processing system designed to process multiple concurrent windows in decentralized networks by sharing partial results across varying window types and aggregation functions, achieving substantial network cost reduction and performance improvements. Deco enables decentralized aggregation of count-based windows via three schemes—Decomon, Decosync, and Decoasync—that adapt to fluctuating event rates and reduce communication overhead while ensuring correctness. Finally, Dema supports decentralized aggregation of non-decomposable functions, such as median and quantile, by offloading computation to local nodes. Collectively, these approaches significantly reduce network traffic, improve throughput, and enhance scalability for decentralized stream processing in IoT environments.</p>
