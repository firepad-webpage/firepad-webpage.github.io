    <title>Secret Sharing with Certified Deletion</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
This study addresses the limitations of traditional secret sharing, which assumes an adversary cannot eventually obtain an authorized set of sharesâ€”a premise that weakens over time with potential security breaches. To mitigate this risk, the authors introduce secret sharing with certified deletion, leveraging quantum mechanics to allow users to verifiably delete shares, ensuring privacy even if adversaries later access an authorized set. The work establishes two key security definitions: no-signaling security, which ensures privacy if non-communicating adversaries delete enough shares, and adaptive security, protecting against adversaries that adaptively corrupt and delete shares while ensuring undeleted shares remain unauthorized. The study constructs two certified deletion schemes: a general secret sharing scheme for any monotone access structure and a threshold scheme built from scratch using novel techniques like generalized XOR extractors and polynomial interpolation. Additionally, high-rate seedless extractors for quantum entropy sources are developed, enhancing efficiency across qubit and qudit registers while reducing entanglement requirements. Efficient share deletion and verification are achieved by measuring in the Fourier basis and producing deletion certificates. Security proofs demonstrate resilience under adaptive attacks using hybrid arguments and cut-and-choose techniques. The study concludes by identifying open challenges, including extending adaptive deletion to general access structures and exploring publicly verifiable deletion certificates.
