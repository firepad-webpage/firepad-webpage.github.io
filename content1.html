    <h2 id="motivation-of-the-study">Motivation of the Study</h2>
    <p>
        Efficient parallel join processing is a fundamental problem in database systems, 
        particularly in massively parallel computation models where network topology 
        significantly affects performance. Traditional approaches assume homogeneous 
        systems, but real-world scenarios involve heterogeneous nodes with varying 
        computational power and network bandwidth, necessitating topology-aware algorithms.
    </p>

    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
    <p>
        Existing parallel join algorithms primarily rely on hashing or sorting techniques, 
        but these are suboptimal when dealing with large-scale data distribution with 
        potential skew. Prior work addressed set intersection and Cartesian products, 
        but a general topology-aware join strategy remained unexplored.
    </p>

    <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
    <p>
        The paper introduces a novel topology-aware parallel join algorithm that generalizes 
        existing approaches for set intersection and Cartesian product to efficiently handle 
        binary joins.
    </p>

    <p>
        The algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality over symmetric tree topologies and minimizes 
        communication cost by balancing load distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
        A sorting-based protocol is used to locally compute joins for keys fully contained within a 
        compute node, reducing unnecessary data movement.
    </p>

    <p>
        The study introduces a method for handling boundary keys, ensuring efficient computation 
        when join keys span multiple compute nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The algorithm achieves a cost-optimality guarantee expressed as:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>$$
            \( L^* = O\left(\max_{e \in E} \frac{1}{w_e} \cdot \sum_{v \in G_e} N_v\right) \)
        $$</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        where \( w_e \) represents bandwidth and \( N_v \) is node capacity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The approach effectively balances Cartesian product computation across tree networks, 
        ensuring that each subtree independently computes assigned products.
    </p>

    <p>
        The algorithm is validated with theoretical proofs and demonstrated to be efficient for 
        large-scale distributed joins.
