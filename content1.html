    <h2>Motivation of the Study</h2>
    <p>There are three issues in current stream processing: (i) decentralized window slicing, (ii) decentralized aggregation of count-based windows, and (iii) decentralized aggregation of windows with non-decomposable functions.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p><strong>Decentralized window slicing:</strong> The processing of data streams often involves many simultaneous queries, resulting in concurrent windows. These windows might overlap and lead to redundant computations and unnecessary resource consumption if processed individually.</p>
    <p><strong>Aggregation of count-based windows:</strong> These approaches are limited to time-based windows with decomposable functions. Time-based windows can be easily divided based on time intervals, allowing multiple nodes to process equally sized time windows. Count-based windows, instead, require data elements to be accumulated based on a fixed number of events, e.g., 1 million events per window, making them challenging to split.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Desis significantly outperforms all baselines and scales well. Also, Desis can reduce over 99% network cost.</p>
    <p>We compare Decoasync with three baselines: Central, Disco, and Scotty. The results show that Decoasync has the highest throughput and lowest network cost since it moves calculations from the root node to local nodes and only sends partial results and a few events via the internet.</p>
    <p>Dema is a decentralized approach designed to process windows with non-decomposable functions in decentralized networks. Dema currently only supports functions that require sorting, such as median and quantile.</p>
