    <h2>Motivation of the Study</h2>
    <p>There are three issues in current stream processing: (i) decentralized window slicing, (ii) decentralized aggregation of count-based windows, and (iii) decentralized aggregation of windows with non-decomposable functions.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p><strong>Decentralized window slicing:</strong> The processing of data streams often involves many simultaneous queries, resulting in concurrent windows. These windows might overlap and lead to redundant computations and unnecessary resource consumption if processed individually.</p>
    <p><strong>Aggregation of count-based windows:</strong> These approaches are limited to time-based windows with decomposable functions. Time-based windows can be easily divided based on time intervals, allowing multiple nodes to process equally sized time windows. Count-based windows, instead, require data elements to be accumulated based on a fixed number of events, e.g., 1 million events per window, making them challenging to split.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Desis significantly outperforms all baselines and scales well. Also, Desis can reduce over 99% network cost.</p>
    <p>We compare Decoasync with three baselines: Central, Disco, and Scotty. The results show that Decoasync has the highest throughput and lowest network cost since it moves calculations from the root node to local nodes and only sends partial results and a few events via the internet.</p>
    <p>Dema is a decentralized approach designed to process windows with non-decomposable functions in decentralized networks. Dema currently only supports functions that require sorting, such as median and quantile.</p>

    <h2>Original Abstract</h2>
    <p>Efficient stream processing is crucial for real-time data analytics, yet existing solutions face challenges in handling decentralized window slicing, count-based window aggregation, and non-decomposable function aggregation. This study addresses these limitations by proposing decentralized approaches that optimize resource usage and scalability. We investigate three key strategies: Desis, which significantly reduces network costs by over 99% while maintaining high performance; Decoasync, which improves throughput and minimizes network overhead by shifting computations to local nodes and transmitting only partial results; and Dema, a decentralized framework for processing non-decomposable functions, specifically supporting operations that require sorting, such as median and quantile computations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approaches outperform existing baselines, offering a scalable and efficient solution for decentralized stream processing. These findings contribute to the development of more effective real-time data analytics frameworks, reducing redundancy and improving computational efficiency in distributed environments.</p>
