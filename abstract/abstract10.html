    <p>The Internetâ€™s promise of fair resource sharing is often undermined when heterogeneous services compete for bandwidth, leading to user dissatisfaction and performance degradation. In this work, we investigate fairness among widely-used Internet services, asking which services emerge as 'winners' or 'losers' under bandwidth contention. Unlike prior work focused primarily on congestion control algorithms (CCAs), we argue that fairness outcomes are influenced by a broader range of service-level design decisions. To empirically evaluate this, we introduce Prudentia, an independent watchdog that assesses the contentiousness and sensitivity of services under varied link conditions. Over two years, Prudentia measured competition between services such as video streaming, file distribution, and web browsing. We find that unfair bandwidth allocation is common: for example, services competing against Mega, a file-distribution application, achieved as little as 20% of their Max-Min Fair share, while services competing with YouTube often exceeded their fair share. We further show that factors like the use of multiple concurrent TCP flows and application-layer scheduling decisions play a significant role in shaping fairness. Our findings highlight the need for evaluating Internet fairness beyond CCAs, revealing complex trade-offs between throughput, latency, and user-perceived quality of experience.</p>
