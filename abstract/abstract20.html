    <p>Open Source Software (OSS) has become a critical component in modern software development, yet it remains vulnerable to OSS poisoning—malicious code injections that are subtle but potentially severe. This study investigates the pull request (PR) process, a core mechanism in OSS collaboration, to identify patterns that deviate from the norm and may signal poisoning risks. Using a process-mining-based approach, we analyze GitHub PR event logs, constructing normal process models across four collaboration scenarios and detecting both control-flow and semantic anomalies. We identified four types of control-flow anomalies with 26 root causes and four types of semantic anomalies with 19 root causes. Our evaluation, based on a multi-case study, reveals that anomalous PR behaviors—such as bypassing reviews, miscommunications, or improper reviewer assignments—occur more frequently in projects with known poisoning incidents. Notably, semantic anomalies are often linked to irregular PR merging practices. While some anomalies are project-specific and benign, cross-project comparisons help surface patterns that deviate significantly from established norms. The findings demonstrate that anomaly detection in the PR process can serve as an early warning mechanism for OSS poisoning and provide a foundation for standardizing secure OSS collaboration practices.</p>
