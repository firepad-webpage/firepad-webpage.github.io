<p>The non-collusion assumption is foundational in privacy-preserving computations such as multi-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR), but its practicality is hindered by the risk of undetectable collusion. This work proposes a shift from the traditional non-collusion model to a rationality-based assumption, wherein servers act to maximize their utility. The authors design and implement a collusion deterrence mechanism using a public bulletin board with payment execution, deployed as a smart contract on Ethereum. This mechanism employs economic incentives, random companion queries, and zero-knowledge accusation verification to discourage rational servers from colluding, even in the absence of any honest parties. The approach remains robust under adversarial conditions, including the presence of malicious servers and strong coalitions, while maintaining the communication efficiency of underlying PIR schemes. Experimental and theoretical analyses confirm that, under appropriate parameter settings, collusion becomes unprofitable, enabling practical, privacy-preserving PIR services without relying on strict non-collusion assumptions.</p>
