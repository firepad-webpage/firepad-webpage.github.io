<p>Programmable network chips are increasingly important for executing complex, stateful network tasks, yet current architectures—pipeline, run-to-completion (RTC), and their hybrids—suffer from rigidity, inefficiency, or poor resource utilization under dynamic conditions. To address these limitations, this work introduces OptimusPrime, a novel programmable network chip architecture with transformable hardware blocks capable of functioning as either pipeline stages or multi-core RTC processors. OptimusPrime supports dual programmability for both hardware roles and user-defined functions, enabling efficient execution of diverse applications such as machine learning aggregation, in-network caching, and network function integration. To program this architecture, the authors propose P4X, a unified language framework combining P4 and embedded C, compiled via a custom backend for resource-optimized deployment. The system is validated through FPGA prototyping and ASIC simulation, demonstrating reduced server queries (by up to 44.9%), improved throughput, and lower latency compared to existing solutions. Overall, OptimusPrime significantly enhances flexibility and performance in programmable data planes, pushing the boundary of software-defined networking.</p>
