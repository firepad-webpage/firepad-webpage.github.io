<p>Data center networks (DCNs) face increasing pressure from high-performance applications such as HPC, which require both high goodput and low latency. Conventional packet-switched DCNs are constrained by the limited capacity of switching chips, a problem exacerbated by the slowdown of Mooreâ€™s Law. While reconfigurable optical DCNs offer greater capacity and cost efficiency, traffic-oblivious designs relying on data relay often degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose NegotiaToR, an on-demand reconfigurable DCN architecture that adapts optical links among top-of-rack (ToR) switches based on dynamic traffic demands. NegotiaToR employs a lightweight distributed scheduling mechanism using only binary demand information and an in-band control plane that enables ToRs to make local scheduling decisions. Its design integrates scheduled one-hop connections with unscheduled connections that piggyback small volumes of mice flows, effectively mitigating scheduling delays, particularly under incasts. Implemented with existing AWGRs and fast-tunable lasers, NegotiaToR remains compatible with flat topologies while maintaining minimal complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that NegotiaToR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art traffic-oblivious schemes, improving goodput and reducing flow completion time (FCT) by one to two orders of magnitude for mice flows. By combining scalability, practicality, and high performance, NegotiaToR advances the design of next-generation reconfigurable DCNs.</p>
