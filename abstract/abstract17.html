    <p>This paper addresses the challenges of accelerating sequence-to-graph (S2G) mapping in genome analysis, a critical step in computational genomics. Traditional sequence-to-sequence (S2S) mapping has been limited in its ability to capture genetic variations due to its reliance on sequential reference genomes. In contrast, S2G mapping integrates genome graphs, which provide a more comprehensive view of genetic variations. However, S2G mapping faces significant performance issues due to the increased complexity of graph processing. The authors propose Harp, a novel accelerator designed to exploit the quasi-sequential nature of genome graphs, a characteristic where over 80% of the human genome graph consists of sequential regions. To address the performance bottleneck, the authors introduce HarpTree, a compact high-level representation of genome graphs, and HarpExt, an algorithm that mitigates the overhead of graph processing during the seed-extension stage. Harp significantly accelerates S2G mapping, achieving up to 140× speedup over existing software and outperforming current hardware accelerators by 23.6× in throughput while reducing chip area by 73%. This work introduces a promising direction for improving genome mapping accuracy and efficiency, which is crucial for applications like personalized medicine and gene therapy.</p>
