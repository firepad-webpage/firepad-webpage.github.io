    <p>The evolution of the Internet has been shaped by its modular, layered architecture and the end-to-end principle (E2EP), which advocates for simplicity and neutrality within the network core. However, growing demands for performance, security, and privacy have led to the proliferation of edge networking services that violate E2EP by introducing application-level functionality within the network infrastructure. Despite their necessity, these services lack standardization and interconnection, fostering vendor lock-in and fragmenting the edge ecosystem. In this paper, we propose InterEdge, an architectural framework designed to restore modularity and interoperability to edge networking services, aligning them more closely with the foundational tenets of the Internet. InterEdge leverages service nodes (SNs) deployed at network edges, providing a unified execution environment with extensible libraries and supporting a Write-Once-Run-Anywhere model. We introduce the InterEdge Lightweight Protocol (ILP) to enable general, efficient, and cacheable packet processing, incorporating secure encryption mechanisms such as PSP. Our prototype prioritizes flexibility to facilitate service development and demonstrates acceptable overheads in microbenchmarks. InterEdge aims to foster a more open and integrated edge service ecosystem, promoting neutrality and ease of deployment across diverse applications and providers.</p>
