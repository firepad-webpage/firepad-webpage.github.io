    <p>CAPTCHAs are a widely deployed web security mechanism, yet their evolving complexity and the rise of behavioral CAPTCHA systems have presented new challenges for defenders. Despite their ubiquity, there has been limited research quantifying the real-world scale of CAPTCHA-targeted attacks. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing C-FRAME, a global measurement system designed to emulate human workers within modern CAPTCHA-farm operations. By leveraging the requirement for CAPTCHA-farms to share detailed target-site information with human solvers, C-FRAME collects large-scale attack data across multiple CAPTCHA services. Over a 92-day deployment, our system captured 425,257 CAPTCHA-solving requests targeting 1,417 domains, including high-profile sites such as Twitter, government portals, and major ticketing platforms. Our hybrid qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals a diverse taxonomy of attacks, including bot-driven account creation, ticket scalping, data scraping, and fraud attempts, spanning 58 countries and 15 languages. Our findings demonstrate how modern CAPTCHA-farm workflows expose valuable insights into global CAPTCHA abuse, providing critical data for the security community to better understand and mitigate such threats.</p>
