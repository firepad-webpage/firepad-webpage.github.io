<p>This work introduces SpannerLib, a Python-based library for rule-based information extraction (IE) that bridges the declarative and imperative programming paradigms. While machine learning-based IE methods, particularly those using large language models (LLMs), have become dominant, their practical deployment often requires extensive orchestration through scenario-specific logic written in imperative languages like Python. SpannerLib addresses this challenge by implementing Spannerlog, a declarative framework that extends Datalog to operate over strings and spans, enabling the integration of user-defined IE functions, including ML models, as callbacks within declarative rules. The system supports seamless communication between Python and Spannerlog via IPython’s Magic system and Pandas DataFrames. Through practical demonstrations—including an LLM-powered code completion pipeline and a rewritten medical text analysis pipeline—SpannerLib significantly reduces orchestration complexity and code volume. For instance, a 4335-line spaCy-based COVID-19 risk classification pipeline was condensed into fewer than 400 lines using SpannerLib. This work highlights the potential of combining logical and statistical approaches to simplify and scale IE development in modern NLP applications.</p>
