    <p>Database queries are commonly used to select and rank items. With the increasing awareness of diversity, ensuring a diverse output (i.e., the representation of different groups in the top-𝑘 positions) becomes essential. To address this challenge, we present Rodeo, a system that generates minimal modifications to queries to enhance the diversity of the ranking they produce based on constraints over groups’ representation in the top-𝑘 for various 𝑘 values.</p>
