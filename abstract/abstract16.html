    <p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing is essential for validating the functionality of mobile applications, but manually constructing GUI test cases is labor-intensive. To reduce this burden, existing methods attempt to migrate test cases between apps with similar functionalities by matching widgets. However, traditional matching approaches often rely on static word embeddings and manually defined functions, which fail to effectively capture contextual semantics and adapt to diverse real-world apps. To address these limitations, we propose TEMdroid, a novel learning-based widget matching approach for test case migration. TEMdroid leverages BERT for contextual information extraction and incorporates a Siamese network for semantic alignment, followed by a widget similarity assessment using cosine distance. We design a two-stage training strategy that incorporates hard-negative sample mining to enhance the matching modelâ€™s robustness. Extensive experiments on the SemFinder dataset demonstrate that TEMdroid significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving an F1-score of 89% in migration tasks, a 12% higher precision than Craftdroid, and reducing migration time by 82%. TEMdroid proves effective in automating GUI test case migration, achieving accurate and efficient results in both controlled and real-world scenarios.</p>
