<p>Bluetooth has become the standard for short-range wireless communication, evolving over 24 years into Bluetooth Classic, Low Energy (BLE), and Mesh. Despite widespread adoption, the protocol has faced a surge of security attacks exploiting design flaws and implementation weaknesses. While prior research has explored individual vulnerabilities, a comprehensive and systematic understanding of Bluetooth security has been lacking. This paper fills that gap by analyzing 76 attacks and 33 defenses drawn from top-tier conference publications. The study categorizes attacks and defenses by Bluetooth stack layers, targeted phases (e.g., discovery, pairing), and threat models, uncovering key insights such as BLE’s susceptibility to privacy attacks during discovery, the persistent risk of user error in pairing, and insufficient defenses against authentication bypass. To address gaps in formal analysis, the authors introduce a comprehensive model for Bluetooth Mesh, implemented in ProVerif and validated across eight modes and eleven properties. The model successfully rediscovers known attacks and confirms the effectiveness of recent mitigations. The publicly released model fosters future research in formal verification and security evaluation. This work offers the first large-scale systematization of Bluetooth security, outlining critical vulnerabilities and proposing future research directions to strengthen the protocol’s security and privacy foundations.</p>
