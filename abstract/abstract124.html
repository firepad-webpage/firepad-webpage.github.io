<p>WAN bandwidth is never too broad â€” and the speed of light stubbornly constant.</p><p>These two fundamental constraints force globally-distributed systems to carefully replicate data close to where they are processed or served.</p><p>A large organization owning such systems adds dimensions of complexity with ever-changing network topologies, strict requirements on failure domains, multiple competing transfers, and layers of software and hardware with multiple kinds of quotas.</p><p>We present Effingo, a throughput-oriented, massively-parallel data copy service we built at Google.</p><p>For its users, Effingo delivers high-throughput transfers with an scp-like interface.</p><p>For Google, Effingo optimizes the network cost with a small footprint on datacenters.</p><p>We experimentally show how Effingo achieves fairness and efficiency through copy tree optimization and dynamic adaptation to changing network conditions.</p><p>On a typical day, Effingo transfers over an exabyte of data between dozens of clusters spread across continents and serves more than 10,000 users.</p>
