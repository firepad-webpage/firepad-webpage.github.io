<p>Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting remains a major challenge in climate and weather prediction, despite its critical importance for disaster preparedness, economic planning, and policy-making. Traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are computationally intensive and inaccessible to non-experts, while most data-driven methods have focused on shorter or longer time horizons, leaving S2S underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ChaosBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate data-driven and physics-based models on the S2S scale. ChaosBench integrates over 45 years of global Earth system reanalysis data—spanning atmospheric, oceanic, ice, and land variables—and includes 44-day ensemble/control forecasts from four national weather agencies. We propose a suite of deterministic, probabilistic, and novel physics-based metrics to evaluate forecasting skill and structural fidelity. Benchmarking results reveal that state-of-the-art data-driven models degrade rapidly on the S2S horizon, often performing worse than climatology due to spectral divergence and blurring. In contrast, ensemble-based and physically-informed models show improved robustness. Our findings highlight the need for a unified and physically-consistent S2S evaluation framework and establish ChaosBench as a foundational resource for advancing the frontier of data-driven weather emulation.</p>
