<p>The growing diversity of data workloads has led to the proliferation of specialized, vertically integrated data management systems, resulting in redundant engineering effort, high maintenance costs, and inconsistent user experiences. Despite sharing a common set of core components, these siloed systems hinder composability and slow innovation. This work advocates for a shift toward a modular architecture, where reusable components with stable APIs enable consistent semantics across transactional, analytical, streaming, and machine learning workloads. A reference composable stack is proposed, highlighting challenges such as inconsistent intermediate representations, lack of runtime standardization, and limited incentives for reusable component development. The approach emphasizes language and execution unification through system-agnostic intermediate representations, and introduces Velox as an example of a unified execution engine. Composability in data systems promises reduced duplication, improved maintainability, and a more coherent user experience, paving the way for a more interoperable and efficient data management ecosystem.</p>
