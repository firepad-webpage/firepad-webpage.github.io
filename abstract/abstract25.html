<p>Vector databases have recently become essential for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling vector similarity search over embedding representations of unstructured data. However, their application in privacy-sensitive domains, such as medical informatics, is hindered by regulatory constraints and the decentralized nature of data storage across institutions. To address this challenge, the authors propose FedSQ, a secure and efficient framework for federated vector similarity queries across distributed vector databases. FedSQ combines local plaintext queries with collaborative secure multi-party computation to ensure privacy protection and query efficiency. It supports local querying using efficient indexing methods like HNSW and aggregates results securely using CrypTen and Protobuf. The system includes a user-friendly web interface built with Vue.js, Python APIs for integration, and a Django backend. Integrated into LLM workflows via LangChain, FedSQ improves the accuracy and recency of model responses by retrieving fresh, relevant external data while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations. This work demonstrates the viability of secure, federated vector search in sensitive domains, balancing utility and privacy.</p>
