<p>In multidisciplinary software projects, such as AAA video game development, traditional code-centric dependency graphs fail to capture the full scope of software artifacts. This paper presents a multidisciplinary dependency graph extracted from a large-scale Ubisoft game project, revealing that non-code artifacts constitute 97.2% of nodes and 95.7% of edges. The study analyzes the impact of cross-boundary changes—modifications affecting multiple disciplines—finding they are common and introduce significantly higher risks of build breakages (51%) and defects (67%) compared to intra-boundary changes (44% and 37%, respectively). Cross-boundary changes typically relate to gameplay, feature additions, and UI development, and are predominantly contributed by a single programming team. In contrast, non-cross-boundary changes often involve tool configurations and bug fixes. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating non-code elements into dependency analysis and suggest that cross-boundary changes warrant increased scrutiny during code review to mitigate risk in multidisciplinary software systems.</p>
