    <p>This paper addresses the challenge of human action anticipation, a task critical for intelligent systems in domains like autonomous driving and human-robot interaction. Traditional methods treat action anticipation as a one-class classification problem, neglecting the dependencies between verb and noun components of actions. To overcome this, we propose the Uncertainty-aware Action Decoupling Transformer (UADT), which models verb-to-noun and noun-to-verb anticipation separately, incorporating predictive uncertainty to guide information flow between components. UADT employs a two-stage training strategy, optimizing encoders for embedding generation before training decoders for joint action prediction. Evaluated on multiple datasets including EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and 50-Salads, UADT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins using only RGB features, with further gains observed through multimodal inputs. Extensive ablation studies confirm the value of uncertainty modeling and the mutual benefit of verb-noun decoupling. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of uncertainty-aware decoupled modeling for real-time action anticipation and opens paths for extending the approach to long-term forecasting and integration with large language models.</p>
