<p>Metagenomic analysis, essential for understanding diverse biological environments, faces significant performance and energy bottlenecks due to large data movement overheads when processing vast genomic databases. Existing acceleration techniques do not fundamentally address the storage I/O inefficiencies inherent in metagenomic workflows. In this work, we present MegIS, the first In-Storage Processing (ISP) system tailored to mitigate data movement overheads in metagenomic analysis pipelines. MegIS introduces a cooperative processing model that orchestrates computation between the SSD and the host system, improving both performance and energy efficiency. We evaluate MegIS using two SSD configurations and benchmark it against state-of-the-art tools: Kraken2, Metalign, and Sieve. Our results demonstrate that MegIS achieves up to 37.2× speedup over Kraken2 and up to 100.2× speedup over Metalign, while also reducing energy consumption by up to 15.2×, all without compromising analysis accuracy. Furthermore, MegIS’s integration incurs minimal hardware overhead, occupying only 1.7% additional area on the SSD controller. These findings establish MegIS as a cost-effective and scalable solution for accelerating metagenomic analysis.</p>
