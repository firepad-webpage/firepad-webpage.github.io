    <p>Selecting effective models for data-driven analysis in domains with limited datasets, such as material science and biology, remains a challenging task. Existing platforms often lack the capability to recommend models without extensive manual tuning or prior knowledge. To address this, we introduce ModsNet, a novel data engine designed to search for high-quality, underutilized pre-trained models based solely on a sample dataset. ModsNet leverages a graph neural network (GNN)-based estimator, combined with a knowledge graph that stores model-dataset interactions and performance metrics, to enable query-time performance estimation. Through a cost-bounded “probe-and-select” strategy, ModsNet identifies promising models for unseen datasets without retraining. Users interact with the system via a simple web interface, requiring only a dataset upload and optional task configuration. Our prototype, implemented in JavaScript and Python, demonstrates significant performance improvements, outperforming alternative methods by 1.3 times in ranking quality (NDCG@10) with an average response time of 0.12 seconds. ModsNet streamlines the model selection process, enabling domain scientists to accelerate data analysis workflows and obtain top-performing model recommendations within seconds.</p>
