<p>Diffusion models have shown great promise in decision-making tasks, particularly in offline reinforcement learning, due to their ability to model complex distributions and generate entire trajectories. However, their high computational cost and low decision-making frequency hinder real-world deployment. To address this, we propose DiffuserLite, a lightweight diffusion planning framework that incorporates a Plan Refinement Process (PRP). PRP begins with rough, interval-based trajectory planning and refines only portions near the current state, reducing sequence length and distribution complexity. This hierarchical, coarse-to-fine strategy enables faster inference, simplified network design, and efficient sampling. DiffuserLite achieves up to 122Hz decision-making frequency, significantly outperforming prior diffusion-based planners in both speed and efficiency, with minimal performance trade-offs. Empirical evaluations on D4RL, Robomimic, and FinRL benchmarks confirm its state-of-the-art competitiveness and real-time applicability. DiffuserLite also demonstrates versatility as a plugin for existing diffusion planners, offering a 560% speed improvement over AlignDiff with only a 3.2% performance drop. These results highlight the potential of PRP-driven lightweight planning in bridging the gap between high-performance trajectory modeling and real-time decision-making.</p>
