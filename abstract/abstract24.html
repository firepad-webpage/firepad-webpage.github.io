<p>Efficient data transfer is critical to the operation of globally distributed systems. This paper presents Effingo, a large-scale data transfer management system developed and deployed at Google. Unlike traditional systems, Effingo emphasizes proactive transfers that optimize for smooth bandwidth usage and network cost while meeting transfer deadlines. Effingo supports service-level objectives (SLOs) over collections of files and destinations, leveraging decentralized heuristics that scale without central coordination. It employs adaptive techniques to optimize copy paths, manage fairness across competing transfers, and respond to resource bottlenecks. Operating at a scale of over an exabyte per day across billions of files, Effingo enables niche optimizations and justified reliability investments. Its architecture—featuring per-cluster deployments, layered quotas, and failure domain isolation—supports a wide variety of users and services. The system’s design integrates cost-aware scheduling, throughput control, and fairness isolation, while maintaining modularity from lower-level bandwidth managers. Through extensive production deployment, Effingo demonstrates how large-scale, deadline-aware, and cost-efficient data transfers can be managed with minimal dependencies and high resiliency.</p>
