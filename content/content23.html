    <p>The non-collusion assumption among computing parties is prevalent across privacy-preserving computations.</p><p>It allows us to solve some important problems, with no known solutions without it.</p><p>It also reduces overheads and allows us to bypass computational hardness results in other problems such as private information retrieval (PIR).</p><p>While most of these distributed systems do allow collusion among pre-defined subsets of parties, all bets are off once the adversary can lure a superset of parties.</p><p>Indeed, using the non-collusion assumption remains highly susceptible to undetectable collusion among computing parties.</p><p>As these distributed systems get considered for applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning, privacy-preserving database/directory searches, and blockchain privacy, the non-collusion assumption is considered an Achilles' heel for large adoption.</p><p>In the context of database querying service, a PIR protocol allows a client to query a database without revealing which piece of information is of interest.</p><p>PIR can be constructed from a single server or multiple servers.</p><p>By involving more non-colluding servers (k >= 2), the communication and computation complexity can be substantially reduced, which serves as a motivation for multi-server PIR schemes.</p><p>However, the non-collusion assumption promoting efficiency improvements calls for practical justification.</p><p>In this paper, we find that by relaxing the non-collusion assumption to the rationality assumption on servers, deterring such privacy-targeted collusion becomes possible.</p><p>The core question is then how to render collusion undesired for rational participants.</p><p>We design and implement a collusion mitigation mechanism on a public bulletin board with payment execution functions, considering only rational and malicious parties with no honest non-colluding servers.</p><p>We devise a mechanism for relaxing the non-collusion assumption in multi-server PIR systems to rationality assumptions on servers.</p><p>We present a practical collusion deterrence mechanism for multi-server PIR so that one can enjoy the perfect efficiency of 1-private PIR.</p><p>This is achieved in harsh settings.</p><p>We employ many servers so that a single server does not bear too much information worth leaking before it is discouraged to collude.</p><p>We examine how servers exit the PIR service and adopt a privacy protection self-insurance to protect user secrets for an extended period after the queries.</p><p>We study how servers form strong coalitions, whose members have complete trust for each other and are immune to the provided incentives, from a cooperative game theory perspective.</p><p>We implement and deploy the mechanism as a smart contract on Ethereum blockchain and apply optimizations to economize the gas costs.</p><p>The solution only adds to the underlying PIR scheme one signed commitment message for each query and response.</p><p>For practicality, we observe that in many settings where the number of available computing parties can be much higher than the required set, an effective collusion mitigation mechanism with practical parameters, i.e., small fee and penalty, can be constructed.</p><p>As a representative example, the proposed mechanism is useful for blockchain access privacy problem.</p><p>We assume all servers are either rational, i.e., taking actions that maximize utilities, or malicious, i.e., behaving arbitrarily.</p><p>There are no honest non-colluding servers.</p><p>We handicap ourselves by giving the adversary advantages in collusion.</p><p>Servers may hold arbitrary knowledge about a user’s index of interest.</p><p>Servers can communicate with each other over any unobserved communication channels.</p><p>We let there exist a secure collusion protocol, e.g., a secure MPC protocol, that can be utilized by colluding parties to compute the result collectively.</p><p>We describe the solution given rational servers.</p><p>We make use of a public bulletin board with payment execution functionality to instantiate the mechanism as a coordinator contract.</p><p>Users know servers’ identities, and they can directly communicate.</p><p>To mitigate collusion, we have participants post commitments of messages on BB for potential evidence verification.</p><p>Since we allow servers to hold arbitrary private knowledge, random companion queries are sent to help distinguish between servers learning user secrets via collusion and via private knowledge.</p><p>Colluding servers can collectively execute any collusion protocol to learn some nontrivial function of the explicit bits of the index or entry.</p><p>A collusion reporter provides the following as evidence: the circuit for computing function, her inputs to the function, and the output from computing it.</p><p>The first correct collusion reporting server for a PIR run is selected as the winner.</p><p>The payment rules are as follows: (1) fine servers submitting false reports; (2) distribute rewards to the winner; (3) penalize each server being successfully accused; (4) charge service fee for each query and pay a queried server that is not successfully accused.</p><p>To realize the incentive scheme, in the beginning, servers make deposits greater than the penalty and fines to CC.</p><p>When T is infinite or finite but unknown, backward induction no longer applies and collusion can become an equilibrium.</p><p>We apply discount rate on future returns because rational agents prefer acquiring the same returns earlier than later.</p><p>In the l-party infinitely repeated collusion game in (l, k, 1)-PIR, the strategy profile of all l servers playing no collusion or gibberish collusion in rounds one and two of each run are the only subgame perfect equilibria when the reward is large enough and the sum of service fee and penalty is large enough.</p><p>To ensure affordable service fees, we define practical service fees mathematically.</p><p>There always exist parameter assignments for inequalities ensuring that servers and users do not falsely accuse, and that collusion is not profitable.</p><p>We now consider a fraction of the l servers to be malicious.</p><p>Malicious servers behave arbitrarily and ignore incentives.</p><p>They bring about two changes to the mechanism.</p><p>First, the incentive mechanism achieves the non-collusion outcome only probabilistically.</p><p>Second, the collusion evidence verification routines can be exploited by malicious servers to function as an expensive oracle for revealing user secrets.</p><p>We adopt zero-knowledge accusation verification.</p><p>We analyze how servers’ exiting strategies and strong coalition formation affect the proposed mechanism and its parameterization.</p><p>We propose a Self-Insurance design tailored to our needs and detain service fees as the self-insurance pool for a certain privacy protection period.</p><p>We extend the analysis to consider strong coalitions formed by servers.</p><p>Servers inside the coalition act in a highly coordinated way.</p><p>Information entering into the group is shared among members.</p><p>Members do not report collusion inside.</p><p>A system designer first evaluates the participating servers and determines a recommended k.</p><p>One can compute the parameters for the collusion game according to inequalities.</p><p>We treat Ethereum as a public bulletin board and conveniently implement the coordinator contract as a smart contract on Ethereum.</p><p>The contract maintains the complete life cycle of PIR service and resolves collusion accusations.</p><p>We preserve the communication complexity of the underlying multi-server PIR.</p><p>Computing SHA-3 hash costs 30 base gas and 6 gas every 256 bits.</p><p>SealPIR has communication complexity and incurs heavy computation.</p><p>The two multi-server PIR schemes are more efficient.</p><p>Our goal is then to preserve the equilibrium in finite games in infinite runs, even when players are highly patient.</p><p>Following the intuition of a secret-shared bit guessing game, we design and implement a mechanism that discourages participants without network advantages from collusion to recover user secrets in multi-server PIR

    <h2>Original Abstract</h2> 
    <p>The non-collusion assumption is foundational in privacy-preserving computations such as multi-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR), but its practicality is hindered by the risk of undetectable collusion. This work proposes a shift from the traditional non-collusion model to a rationality-based assumption, wherein servers act to maximize their utility. The authors design and implement a collusion deterrence mechanism using a public bulletin board with payment execution, deployed as a smart contract on Ethereum. This mechanism employs economic incentives, random companion queries, and zero-knowledge accusation verification to discourage rational servers from colluding, even in the absence of any honest parties. The approach remains robust under adversarial conditions, including the presence of malicious servers and strong coalitions, while maintaining the communication efficiency of underlying PIR schemes. Experimental and theoretical analyses confirm that, under appropriate parameter settings, collusion becomes unprofitable, enabling practical, privacy-preserving PIR services without relying on strict non-collusion assumptions.</p>
