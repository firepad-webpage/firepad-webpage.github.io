    <p>With more and more applications running in the cloud, traffic demands in DCNs increase continuously.</p><p>Among the applications, tasks like high performance computing (HPC) are greatly affected by both goodput and latency, putting stringent requirements on the network.</p><p>However, existing packet-switched DCNs struggle to meet these requirements due to inadequate capacity of switching chips which will worsen with the slowdown of Moore’s Law.</p><p>To address this, the development of optical switching technology especially fast optical switching has led researchers to turn to reconfigurable optical DCNs, which provide higher capacity as well as lower cost compared with packet switching.</p><p>Unlike packet-switched networks that rely on buffers to absorb conflicts, bufferless optical switching requires synchronous scheduling and reconfiguration to accommodate the dynamic traffic demands including incasts.</p><p>Recently, traffic-oblivious reconfigurable DCNs have drawn researchers’ attention because of their simplicity.</p><p>They schedule the network according to predefined rules and use data relay to cope with dynamic traffic patterns.</p><p>However, despite their simplicity, the data-relay design can lead to compromised performance in goodput and latency.</p><p>Consequently, there is a growing need for a new design that can effectively handle dynamic traffic demands, ensuring both high goodput and low latency while still maintaining feasibility.</p><p>We present NegotiaToR, an on-demand reconfigurable DCN architecture with a simple design.</p><p>With in-band distributed scheduling, it dynamically adapts the optical links among top-of-rack (ToR) switches to traffic demands, and sends data directly to destinations through one-hop paths.</p><p>Beyond the scheduled connections, NegotiaToR also provides unscheduled connections, mitigating the impact of scheduling delays even under incasts.</p><p>Utilizing existing arrayed waveguide grating routers (AWGR) and fast-tunable lasers, NegotiaToR is compatible with prevalent flat topologies, achieving a better performance than the state-of-the-art traffic-oblivious scheme on the same hardware with similar complexity.</p><p>On-demand is an intuitive solution to handle the dynamic traffic in DCNs, especially for unpredictable ToR-ToR traffic where demand forecasting based on historical data is difficult.</p><p>The key challenge of NegotiaToR thus lies in realizing scalable on-demand scheduling with high practicality.</p><p>NegotiaToR’s demand information is binary.</p><p>No data size information is needed by the scheduling algorithm.</p><p>Meanwhile, NegotiaToR distributes the scheduling to ToRs, where each ToR only accounts for the scheduling of ingoing and outgoing traffic, achieving a comparable low complexity with traffic-oblivious designs.</p><p>NegotiaToR implements an in-band control plane, where all ToRs periodically establish all-to-all connectivity with fast optical switching.</p><p>The scheduling algorithm runs on it in a pipelined manner.</p><p>Senders can access the scheduling results locally and tune lasers to the derived wavelength without the need to deliver scheduling results.</p><p>NegotiaToR utilizes the periodical all-to-all connectivity to piggyback a small volume of mice flow data along with scheduling messages, providing opportunities to bypass scheduling delays.</p><p>This effectively manages incasts, promising application performance even under concurrent traffic demands.</p><p>The design of NegotiaToR is guided by the principle of Occam’s Razor.</p><p>We evaluate NegotiaToR through simulations on two representative flat topologies.</p><p>Results show that NegotiaToR outperforms the state-of-the-art traffic-oblivious reconfigurable DCN design under comparable complexity, both in FCT and goodput.</p><p>Particularly, NegotiaToR’s mice flow FCT is one to two orders of magnitude better.</p><p>NegotiaToR is a simple network architecture for reconfigurable DCNs where bufferless optical links connect buffered ToRs.</p><p>With minimal traffic demand information, it schedules traffic distributedly on the ToRs via the in-band control plane in an on-demand while scalable manner.</p><p>NegotiaToR employs a distributed scheduling mechanism on a per-epoch basis, where an epoch is a fixed-length time interval.</p><p>Each epoch comprises two phases, working as the in-band control plane and data plane.</p><p>All packets are transmitted directly to their destinations through one-hop paths.</p><p>To mitigate the impact of scheduling delays, especially under incasts, NegotiaToR also piggybacks a small volume of data with scheduling messages utilizing the unscheduled connections in the predefined phase, bypassing the scheduling delay especially for latency-sensitive mice flows.</p><p>NegotiaToR Matching enables scalable on-demand coordination among ToRs in a distributed manner.</p><p>NegotiaToR Matching achieves high performance in both goodput and FCT across these topologies.</p><p>NegotiaToR can still achieve good performance, showing the good generality of its design.</p><p>NegotiaToR achieves better mice flow FCT at all loads regardless of topologies.</p><p>With priority queues enabled, NegotiaToR’s FCT is consistently one to two orders of magnitude better.</p><p>Regarding goodput, NegotiaToR remarkably outperforms the traffic-oblivious scheme on both topologies at high loads.</p><p>NegotiaToR’s on-demand scheduling can better utilize the network’s bandwidth and reduce bandwidth waste.</p><p>NegotiaToR maintains comparable performance under identical parameter settings, where the performance on the thin-clos topology is marginally lower than on the parallel network due to its limited connectivity.</p><p>NegotiaToR incorporates a mechanism for handling link failures.</p><p>Upon detecting a link failure, ToRs will alert the maintainers and broadcast the detected failures to update their scheduling rules.</p><p>Upon link recovery, the bandwidth usage returns to its pre-failure level.</p><p>With data piggybacking in the predefined phase and mice flow priority queues in ToRs, mice flow FCT is reduced, most of which is even below the scheduling delay.</p><p>NegotiaToR converges to its present form, which is orchestrated towards a minimalist design.</p><p>We acknowledge that our exploration has not covered the entire design spectrum.</p><p>As DCN applications continue to develop, we believe there are

    <h2>Original Abstract</h2> 
    <p>Data center networks (DCNs) face increasing pressure from high-performance applications such as HPC, which require both high goodput and low latency. Conventional packet-switched DCNs are constrained by the limited capacity of switching chips, a problem exacerbated by the slowdown of Moore’s Law. While reconfigurable optical DCNs offer greater capacity and cost efficiency, traffic-oblivious designs relying on data relay often degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose NegotiaToR, an on-demand reconfigurable DCN architecture that adapts optical links among top-of-rack (ToR) switches based on dynamic traffic demands. NegotiaToR employs a lightweight distributed scheduling mechanism using only binary demand information and an in-band control plane that enables ToRs to make local scheduling decisions. Its design integrates scheduled one-hop connections with unscheduled connections that piggyback small volumes of mice flows, effectively mitigating scheduling delays, particularly under incasts. Implemented with existing AWGRs and fast-tunable lasers, NegotiaToR remains compatible with flat topologies while maintaining minimal complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that NegotiaToR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art traffic-oblivious schemes, improving goodput and reducing flow completion time (FCT) by one to two orders of magnitude for mice flows. By combining scalability, practicality, and high performance, NegotiaToR advances the design of next-generation reconfigurable DCNs.</p>
