    <h2>Excerpt</h2>
    <p>After the Viking King Harald Bluetooth united the Danish tribes over 1,000 years ago, his “legacy”, the Bluetooth protocol, has become the de facto standard for short-range wireless communications today.</p><p>Since the introduction of Bluetooth (Basic Rate, BR) in 1999, new features, such as Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) and High Speed (HS), have been added to improve its performance.</p><p>Later, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Bluetooth Mesh (Mesh) were released paving the way for its domination in the era of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G.</p><p>Meanwhile, attacks against Bluetooth (e.g., BlueBorne, BleedingBit, KNOB, BIAS, and BLESA) have been booming in the past few years, impacting billions of devices.</p><p>These attacks exploit both design issues in the Bluetooth specification and implementation flaws in its implementations allowing for privilege escalation, remote code execution, breaking cryptography, spoofing, etc.</p><p>While Bluetooth security as a research field has already drawn significant attention from the community, a systematic understanding of this field is still missing, impeding the advancement of this field.</p><p>To address these issues, in this paper, we provide a systematic study to categorize what has been done in the field of Bluetooth security, and to highlight what is missing and should be done as future work.</p><p>We first provide an overview of the evolution of Bluetooth security and privacy features since its first version.</p><p>Then, we systematize the field of Bluetooth security by diving into 76 attacks and 33 defenses.</p><p>To reason about known attacks, we categorize them based on the layers of the Bluetooth stack they target and the attack techniques they use.</p><p>Similarly, we categorize defenses according to the layers of the Bluetooth stack they are designed to protect and the defense techniques they use.</p><p>To provide more insights, we also specify their scope (e.g., targeting only BC or more), affected phase (e.g., device discovery phase and data transmission phase), and attack models (e.g., whether the device is compromised or not).</p><p>These studies allow us to cross-check the attack and defense systematization to have a big picture of today’s Bluetooth security.</p><p>Our findings, to name a few, include: 1) the BLE device discovery phase draws most privacy attacks; 2) pairing security faces challenges caused by users’ mistakes; 3) Bluetooth specification has different assumptions from its implementations on modern operating systems (OSes); 4) while being effective in finding firmware vulnerabilities, Bluetooth fuzzing has limited support for the host code; 5) there is no effective defense against attacks exploiting users’ mistakes; 6) defenses against attacks targeting BC and BLE encryption are still missing.</p><p>Building upon our systematization, we find that formal analysis of Bluetooth is effective in finding design vulnerabilities in the specification.</p><p>However, the existing formal analysis of Mesh only considers its provisioning protocol, leaving other security-related protocols uncovered.</p><p>Thus, to fill this gap, we take one step towards securing Mesh by proposing a comprehensive Mesh formal model covering all security-related protocols.</p><p>We implement our formal model using ProVerif and verify 11 properties covering all 8 different modes.</p><p>Using our model, we rediscover 2 known attacks against Mesh.</p><p>In addition, we also use our model to confirm that Mesh is not vulnerable to any known attacks anymore after applying the fixes suggested by Bluetooth SIG.</p><p>To foster future research in this field, our model is publicly available.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to systematically examine Bluetooth security.</p><p>Moreover, we provide promising directions, e.g., more comprehensive exploration of BLE and Mesh privacy, cross-stack security and privacy evaluation, and comprehensive Bluetooth fuzzing, to shed some light on future Bluetooth security research.</p><p>Bluetooth is a short-range radio frequency standard, maintained by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), for data exchange between different devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and headsets.</p><p>During the past 24 years, from version 1.0 to version 5.4 (the latest version at the time of the paper writing), Bluetooth has evolved into three different protocols, namely Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth Low Energy, and Bluetooth Mesh.</p><p>Regardless of the used protocol, Bluetooth communication can be divided into three phases: device discovery, key sharing, and data exchange.</p><p>Since version 5.2, the specification requires that the entropy of the encryption key is at least 7 bytes to mitigate the KNOB attacks against encryption exploiting the allowance of and encryption key with one-byte-entropy.</p><p>Since Bluetooth 5.4, the Secure Connections Only (SCO) mode has been introduced.</p><p>In this mode, a device can only use state-of-the-art security features and FIPS-approved algorithms, i.e., SSP with authenticated pairing methods (e.g., NC and PE), secure authentication, and AES-CCM with a 128-bit-entropy encryption key.</p><p>Thus, if both devices are Bluetooth 5.4-compliant and in the SCO mode, they are immune to all the above-mentioned attacks exploiting design flaws of the security features.</p><p>To address this issue, since Bluetooth 5.2, the specification has required that the maximum interval between MAC address change is 15 minutes.</p><p>In the latest version of Mesh specification at the time of the paper writing, the weaknesses of the provisioning protocol mentioned earlier still exist.</p><p>However, these weaknesses are addressed via advisories from the SIG.</p><p>Bluetooth is getting more secure.</p><p>Bluetooth is getting more private.</p><p>Backward compatibility comes before security.</p><p>To study existing attacks and defenses of Bluetooth and summarize their similarities and differences, we first conduct a survey of Bluetooth attacks and defenses of existing research covering all the papers published in the big four top-tier conferences (i.e., S&P, USENIX Security, CCS, and NDSS) from 2000 to March 2023.</p><p>To further understand the capabilities of the attacks and the scope of the proposed defenses, we classify the surveyed attacks and defenses by their affected layers.</p><p>In general, attacks and defenses targeting BLE and Mesh require weaker hardware capabilities compared with BC.</p><p>BLE device discovery phase draws most privacy attacks.</p><p>Pairing security faces challenges caused by users’ mistakes.</p><p>Bluetooth specification has different assumptions from its implementations on modern OSes.</p><p>Bluetooth fuzzing tools are effective yet not comprehensive.</p><p>There is no effective defense against attacks exploiting users’ mistakes.</p><p>Defenses against authentication bypass and breaking encryption are still missing.</p><p>Formal analysis of Bluetooth is incomplete.</p><p>As the table shows, our model can discover existing attacks, including BlueMAN, BlueMirror, and the MitM attacks against the non-authenticated configuration procedure.</p><p>We verify all the properties (P1 - P11) in all the 8 modes denoted by M1 to M8, respectively.</p><p>We also verify these properties after applying the fix to known attacks following the adversaries from Bluetooth SIG.</p><p>Using our model, we rediscover 2 known attacks

    <h2>Original Abstract</h2> 
    <p>Named after the Viking King Harald Bluetooth, Bluetooth is the de facto standard for short-range wireless communications. The introduction of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Mesh protocols has further paved the way for its domination in the era of IoT and 5G. Meanwhile, attacks against Bluetooth, such as BlueBorne, BleedingBit, KNOB, BIAS, and BLESA, have been booming in the past few years, impacting billions of devices. While Bluetooth security has drawn significant attention from the security research community, a systematic understanding of this field is still missing, impeding the advancement of this field.</p> <p>In this paper, we first summarize the evolution of Bluetooth security in the specification in the past 24 years. Then, we provide a systematization of Bluetooth security by diving into 76 attacks and 33 defenses presented by previous research in this area. We first categorize attacks and defenses based on their affected layers and protocols in the Bluetooth stack as well as their threat models. Then, we cross-check the attacks and defenses to have a big picture of Bluetooth security. Based on the systematization, we find that the existing formal analyses of Bluetooth do not cover most of the security aspects of Bluetooth Mesh. Lastly, we take a step towards securing Bluetooth Mesh by designing and implementing a comprehensive formal model of Bluetooth Mesh covering all its security-related protocols. Our systematization reveals, for instance, that the security of Bluetooth pairing faces challenges caused by users’ mistakes, and that Bluetooth fuzzing is effective yet not comprehensive. Based on the systematization, we provide promising future directions to shed some light on future Bluetooth security research.</p>
