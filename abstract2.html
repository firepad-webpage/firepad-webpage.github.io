  Metagenomic analysis presents a significant computational challenge due to its high data movement overhead, requiring access to large amounts of low-reuse data. Traditional workflows involve sequencing, basecalling, and metagenomic analysis, with data frequently moving from storage to processing units, leading to inefficiencies in performance and energy consumption. This study introduces MegIS, a novel approach designed to mitigate these issues by optimizing data movement and computation. Experimental results demonstrate that MegIS achieves substantial energy reductions, outperforming Kraken2 and Sieve by factors of 5.4× and 1.9×, respectively, and reducing energy consumption by 15.2× compared to Metalign. Additionally, MegIS delivers speedups ranging from 1.5× to 5.1× over state-of-the-art metagenomic tools while maintaining high accuracy. With a minimal hardware footprint—occupying only 1.7% additional area over three SSD controller cores—MegIS offers an efficient, scalable solution for metagenomic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of MegIS to significantly improve the efficiency of large-scale metagenomic workflows, addressing critical bottlenecks in data movement and processing.</p>
