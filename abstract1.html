<p>Efficient stream processing is crucial for real-time data analytics, yet existing solutions face challenges in handling decentralized window slicing, count-based window aggregation, and non-decomposable function aggregation. This study addresses these limitations by proposing decentralized approaches that optimize resource usage and scalability. We investigate three key strategies: Desis, which significantly reduces network costs by over 99% while maintaining high performance; Decoasync, which improves throughput and minimizes network overhead by shifting computations to local nodes and transmitting only partial results; and Dema, a decentralized framework for processing non-decomposable functions, specifically supporting operations that require sorting, such as median and quantile computations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approaches outperform existing baselines, offering a scalable and efficient solution for decentralized stream processing. These findings contribute to the development of more effective real-time data analytics frameworks, reducing redundancy and improving computational efficiency in distributed environments.</p>
