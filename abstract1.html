Efficient parallel join processing is a critical challenge in modern database systems, particularly within heterogeneous, large-scale distributed environments where network topology significantly impacts performance. Traditional parallel join algorithms, primarily based on hashing and sorting techniques, fall short when dealing with data distribution skew and varying node capabilities. This study introduces a novel topology-aware parallel join algorithm that generalizes existing approaches for set intersection and Cartesian products to efficiently handle binary joins. The proposed algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality for symmetric tree topologies by minimizing communication costs and balancing load distribution across compute nodes. A sorting-based protocol enables local join computation for keys fully contained within individual nodes, while an innovative boundary key handling mechanism ensures efficient processing when join keys span multiple nodes. The approach guarantees cost-optimality, expressed as 
\( L^* = O\left(\max_{e \in E} \frac{1}{w_e} \sum_{v \in G_e} N_v\right) \), where \( w_e \) represents bandwidth and \( N_v \) denotes node capacity. Theoretical proofs and experimental evaluations demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency and scalability for large-scale distributed joins, offering a significant advancement in topology-aware data processing.
