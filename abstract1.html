<p>Wide Area Networks (WANs) remain susceptible to outages due to the complexity of their control infrastructures, particularly in centralized Software-Defined Networking (cSDN) systems. This paper proposes dSDN, a decentralized SDN control architecture designed to significantly reduce WAN control plane complexity without compromising performance or resiliency. dSDN eliminates reliance on external components by enabling on-box operations, leveraging source routing and traffic engineering (TE) algorithms to decentralize path computations. Through empirical evaluation on an Arista 7808 router, dSDN is shown to operate under 50% CPU utilization, while achieving up to 100x faster convergence times and 10-100x lower service-level objective (SLO) impacts compared to cSDN across diverse network topologies and failure scenarios. Furthermore, dSDN restores fate-sharing principles traditionally seen in legacy protocols, enhancing network robustness. This work presents dSDN as a practical, scalable alternative to current WAN control architectures, offering a path toward simpler and more resilient network operations.</p>
