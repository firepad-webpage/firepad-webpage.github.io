content1.html,"Efficient parallel join processing is a critical challenge in modern database systems, particularly within heterogeneous, large-scale distributed environments where network topology significantly impacts performance. Traditional parallel join algorithms, primarily based on hashing and sorting techniques, fall short when dealing with data distribution skew and varying node capabilities. This study introduces a novel topology-aware parallel join algorithm that generalizes existing approaches for set intersection and Cartesian products to efficiently handle binary joins. The proposed algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality for symmetric tree topologies by minimizing communication costs and balancing load distribution across compute nodes. A sorting-based protocol enables local join computation for keys fully contained within individual nodes, while an innovative boundary key handling mechanism ensures efficient processing when join keys span multiple nodes. The approach guarantees cost-optimality, expressed as 
L^* = O\left(\max_{e \in E} \frac{1}{w_e} \sum_{v \in G_e} N_v\right) , where {w_e}​ represents bandwidth and N_v denotes node capacity. Theoretical proofs and experimental evaluations demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency and scalability for large-scale distributed joins, offering a significant advancement in topology-aware data processing."

Community Preference Optimization (COMPO) addresses this challenge by incorporating community-specific context into preference optimization, drawing inspiration from recommender systems. To enable this approach, the COMPRED dataset was introduced, containing over 1 million preference pairs from 187 subreddits across five domains, including science, finance, history, politics, and gender/sexuality. These preferences are inferred from Reddit’s post-comment structure, leveraging upvotes as a proxy for community endorsement. Experiments demonstrate that integrating subreddit context into reward models significantly improves preference prediction, especially in politically and culturally sensitive discussions. Evaluations using the Llama-2 7B model show that COMPO outperforms existing baselines in both automated and human assessments, particularly in domains where community-specific norms are pronounced. Human evaluation results highlight that COMPO-generated responses align more closely with subreddit-specific values, achieving a 46.5% preference rate over baselines. Further analysis reveals that explicit contextualization is most beneficial when subreddit predictability is low, suggesting a strategic approach to community-aware language modeling. These findings underscore the value of community-level preference modeling in improving language model personalization while preserving individual privacy.

content3.html,"This study addresses the limitations of traditional secret sharing, which assumes an adversary cannot eventually obtain an authorized set of shares—a premise that weakens over time with potential security breaches. To mitigate this risk, the authors introduce secret sharing with certified deletion, leveraging quantum mechanics to allow users to verifiably delete shares, ensuring privacy even if adversaries later access an authorized set. The work establishes two key security definitions: no-signaling security, which ensures privacy if non-communicating adversaries delete enough shares, and adaptive security, protecting against adversaries that adaptively corrupt and delete shares while ensuring undeleted shares remain unauthorized. The study constructs two certified deletion schemes: a general secret sharing scheme for any monotone access structure and a threshold scheme built from scratch using novel techniques like generalized XOR extractors and polynomial interpolation. Additionally, high-rate seedless extractors for quantum entropy sources are developed, enhancing efficiency across qubit and qudit registers while reducing entanglement requirements. Efficient share deletion and verification are achieved by measuring in the Fourier basis and producing deletion certificates. Security proofs demonstrate resilience under adaptive attacks using hybrid arguments and cut-and-choose techniques. The study concludes by identifying open challenges, including extending adaptive deletion to general access structures and exploring publicly verifiable deletion certificates."
